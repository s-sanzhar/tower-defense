# Tower Defense Game

## Introduction
The following repository contains a tower defense game written on PyQt5 
and Python's standard libraries. The game has been created as a final 
project for the 2022 edition of the Basics in Programming Y2 course 
at Aalto University.

## File and directory structure
The repository consists of program files (_app.py, board.py, waves.json, 
etc_), an images directory (_Images_), a directory for the unit tests 
(_tests_), and a directory for the project documents(_Documents_). 
There is no separate directory for the application codes.

## Installation instructions
In general, the program requires the PyQt5 library to be installed. Otherwise, only built-in Python libraries are used, including _math, copy, sys, time and json_.
Simple import command would be enough to use those libraries (has been implemented in the code). 

## User instructions
In order to execute the program, simply download the repository and 
unzip it. Open it in _PyCharm 2020_ (or other IDE of your choice), install PyQt5 (if needed) and run the _app.py_ file. After that, the pop-up window will appear and you can play the game.
